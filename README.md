# It's a bar that's far away

[enter the farbar](https://play.workadventu.re/_/global/raw.githubusercontent.com/darachm/farbar/master/farbar.json)

The idea is to for this to be a remote pub, a persistent hangout.
So it's a quickly whipped together map on [WorkAdventure](workadventu.re),
because they're open source.

( browser window, desktop/laptops work great, I don't think phones do )
